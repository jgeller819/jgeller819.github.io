Well, since I decided that I no longer wanted to pay GoDaddy to host my site and I've been meaning to start a blog for a while, I figured there was no time like the present to move everything over to Github Pages and start using Jekyll.

Since this is a blog, I guess I should probably write a bit about myself. I'm a senior computer science major at Williams College, due to graduate this June. Kinda weird that leaving here is a thing. I've got plenty to keep me busy until then, so I probably won't have too much time until the very end to do any reminiscing.

I'm taking four(ish) classes this semester:
   *    CS 339 -- Distributed Systems
   *    Philosophy 202 -- History of Modern Philosophy
   *    History 228 -- Europe in the 20th Century
   *    CS 499 -- Honors Thesis

I'll talk more about these all in future posts, especially my thesis, since it's basically dominating my life at this point. Eventually I might even throw in some code so I can keep messing around with Jekyll, which seems pretty awesome so far.
